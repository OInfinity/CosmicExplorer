#  Cosmic Explorer - Space Discoveries  
*A futuristic, interactive learning experience visualizing the evolution of the universe.*

---

## Overview

Cosmic Explorer presents the history of the universe through a dual-column interface designed for clarity and immersion.  
On the left, users scroll through chronological discoveries — on the right, a visual spotlight displays each event like a curated museum exhibit.

This isn't a static page.  
It's a guided expedition through time, matter, stars, and observation.

###  Visual Identity  
- Space-theme black surface with warm glows  
- Clean UI hierarchy — no clutter, no distraction  
- Text teaches, image reinforces, layout breathes

## How to Use

1. Open `LearnMore.html` in any modern browser  
2. Scroll through discoveries using the left panel  
3. The right panel updates visually as chapters change  
4. Navigation buttons offer quick switching and page transitions  

No setup. No dependencies. Pure front-end execution.

## Why It Stands Out


It was made with both attention and intention.

The layout separates **narrative** from **visual memory**, making learning natural and memorable — like walking through a cosmic exhibit instead of reading a flat page.

Users don’t just consume space history.  
They *experience* it.
