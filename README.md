# 🌌 Cosmic Explorer — Space Discoveries  
*A futuristic, interactive learning experience visualizing the evolution of the universe.*

---

## Overview

Cosmic Explorer presents the history of the universe through a dual-column interface designed for clarity and immersion.  
On the left, users scroll through chronological discoveries — on the right, a visual spotlight displays each event like a curated museum exhibit.

This isn't a static page.  
It's a guided expedition through time, matter, stars, and observation.

## Roadmap

| Feature | Status |
|--------|:------:|
| Scroll-synced auto image switching | 🔜 Upcoming |
| Fade-in scroll reveal animations | 🔜 Upcoming |
| Ambient audio & space SFX | 🔜 Future |

## Why It Stands Out

Because this isn't just text and pictures.  
It's presentation with intention.

The layout separates **narrative** from **visual memory**, making learning natural and memorable — like walking through a cosmic exhibit instead of reading a flat page.

Users don’t just consume space history.  
They *experience* it.
